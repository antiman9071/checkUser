# checkUser
a simple linux code to check, add, remove, and change permissions of users

checkUser.sh [firewall] [adduser] [addgroup]

the check user script is built to check authorized users and remove unauthorized users. It is built to be self explanatory all you need to do is follow the prompts. [] means that it is optional

all options are interchangeable this is just the order I put them in the code

firewall starts the firewall on ubuntu systems

adduser adds multiple users to the computer and can add the users to a already existing group

addgroup adds multiple users to a group and can create new groups
