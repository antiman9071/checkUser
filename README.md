checkUser.sh [-f] [-a] [-g] [-u] [-m] [-p]
the check user script is built to check authorized users and remove unauthorized users. It is built to be self explanatory all you need to do is follow the prompts. [] means that it is optional
all options are interchangeable this is just the order I put them in the code
-f starts the firewall on ubuntu systems
-a adds multiple users to the computer and can add the users to a already existing group
-g adds multiple users to a group and can create new groups
-u runs the distro's update command (currently it is only apt based systems)
-m finds all video and audio files in the home directory
-p allows you to change the password of a user, it will not check a users password however it will set password rules
