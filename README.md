checkUser.sh [firewall] [adduser] [addgroup] [update] [mediaFiles] [password]

the check user script is built to check authorized users and remove unauthorized users. It is built to be self explanatory all you need to do is follow the prompts. [] means that it is optional, all options are interchangeable this is just the order I put them in the code

firewall starts the firewall on ubuntu systems

adduser adds multiple users to the computer and can add the users to a already existing group

addgroup adds multiple users to a group and can create new groups

update runs the distro's update command (currently it is only apt based systems)

mediaFiles finds all video and audio files in the home directory

password alllows you to change the password of a user, it will not check a users password
